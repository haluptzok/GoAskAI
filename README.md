How do I know if I'm in love?
GoAskAI chatbot says: There is no specific formula for knowing whether you are in love, as it can be a subjective experience that varies from person to person. However, some common signs that you may be in love include:

1. Thinking about the person often and feeling a strong desire to be close to them.

2. Feeling happy and content when you are with the person.

3. Feeling physically attracted to the person.

If you are experiencing these feelings or similar emotions then it could be a sign that you are in love. However, it's important to remember that everyone's experience of love is different, and what you feel may be unique to you.
